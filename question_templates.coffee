      On a number line, point A lies at [[ a ]] and point B lies at [[ b ]]. 
      What is the coordinate of the point that is exactly halfway between points A and B?
      '''
    explanation:
      '''
      The point on a number line halfway between [[ a ]] and [[ b ]] will be the average of the two numbers.
      The average of [[ a ]] and [[ b ]] is the sum of the numbers divided by 2:
      
        $$ {[[ a ]] + [[ b ]] \\over 2} = {[[ sum ]] \\over 2} = [[ correctAnswer ]] $$ 
      
      Alternately, you could subtract [[ a ]] from [[ b ]] to get the distance between the points ([[ diff ]]) 
      and divide that distance by 2 to arrive at [[ halfdiff ]]:
      
        $$ {[[ b ]] - [[ a ]] \\over 2} =  {[[ diff ]] \\over 2} = [[ halfdiff ]] $$
      
      
      This is how far the halfway point will 
      be from either of the two outside points:
      
       $$ [[ a ]] + [[ halfdiff ]] = [[ correctAnswer ]] $$ or
       $$ [[ b ]] - [[ halfdiff ]] = [[ correctAnswer ]] $$

      what is the least possible value for \\(k\\)?

    explanation: '''
      Substituting \\([[ n ]]k\\) for \\(x\\), we get that \\(f([[ n ]]k) = [[ c ]] + {([[ n ]]k)^2 \\over [[ nn ]] }\\). 
      We're also told that \\(f([[ n ]]k) = [[ b ]]k\\), so we can set the two expressions equal.
      
      $$[[ c ]] + {([[ n ]]k)^2 \\over [[ nn ]]} = [[ b ]]k$$
      $$[[ c ]] + { [[ nn ]]k^2 \\over [[ nn ]]} = [[ b ]]k$$
      $$[[ c ]] + k^2 = [[ b ]]k$$
      $$k^2 - [[ b ]]k + [[ c ]] = 0$$
      $$(k - [[ small ]])(k - [[ big ]]) = 0$$
      $$k = { [[ small ]], [[ big ]] }$$

      So the two possible values for \\(k\\) are [[ small ]] and [[ big ]], and thus [[ small ]] is the least possible solution.
