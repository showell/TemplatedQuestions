      '''
    explanation:
      '''
      This is really two problems in one.  First, solve each problem separately.
    
      Solve for [[ var1 ]] first, using the property that multiplying powers of the same
      base is equivalent to adding the exponents.
    
        $$ a ^ [[ var1 ]] * a ^ [[ var1 ]] = a ^ { [[ val1_times_2 ]] } $$
        $$ a ^ { [[ var1 ]] + [[ var1 ]] } = a ^ { [[ val1_times_2 ]] } $$
        $$ [[ var1 ]] + [[ var1 ]] = [[ val1_times_2 ]] $$
        $$ [[ var1 ]] = [[ val1 ]] $$
        
      Now solve for [[ var2 ]], using the property that taking a power to another power is
      equivalent to multiplying the exponents:
      
        $$ (a ^ { [[ e ]] } ) ^ { [[ var2 ]] } = a ^ { [[ val2_times_e ]] } $$
        $$ a ^ { [[ e ]] * [[ var2 ]] } = a ^ { [[ val2_times_e ]] } $$
        $$ [[ e ]] * [[ var2 ]] = [[ val2_times_e ]] $$
        $$ [[ var2 ]] = [[ val2 ]] $$
        
      Since \\( [[ var1 ]] = [[ val1 ]] \\) and \\( [[ var2 ]] = [[ val2 ]] \\):

      The fact that two of the triangle's interior angles are congruent means that the triangle is

    explanation:
      '''
      The point on a number line halfway between [[ a ]] and [[ b ]] will be the average of the two numbers.
